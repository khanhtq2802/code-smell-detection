It is an acronym for XML Stylesheet:\n *      Transformations Compiler\n *\n *   2) A stylesheet is a description of how to transform an input XML document\n *      into a resultant output XML document (or HTML document or text)\n *\n *   3) An axis is a particular \"dimension\" in a tree representation of an XML\n *      document; the nodes in the tree are divided along different axes.\n *      Traversing the \"child\" axis, for instance, means that the program\n *      would visit each child of a particular node; traversing the \"descendant\"\n *      axis means that the program would visit the child nodes of a particular\n *      node, their children, and so on until the leaf nodes of the tree are\n *      reached.\n *\n *   4) An iterator is an object that traverses nodes in a tree along a\n *      particular axis, one at a time.\n *\n *   5) An element is a mark-up tag in an XML document; an attribute is a\n *      modifier on the tag.  For example, in <elem attr='val' attr2='val2'>\n *      \"elem\" is an element name, \"attr\" and \"attr2\" are attribute names with\n *      the values \"val\" and \"val2\", respectively.\n *\n *   6) A namespace declaration is a special attribute that is used to associate\n *      a prefix with a URI (the namespace).  The meanings of element names and\n *      attribute names that use that prefix are defined with respect to that\n *      namespace.\n *\n *   7) DOM is an acronym for Document Object Model.  It is a tree\n *      representation of an XML document.\n *\n *      SAX is an acronym for the Simple API for XML processing.  It is an API\n *      used inform an XML processor (in this case XSLTC) of the structure and\n *      content of an XML document.\n *\n *      Input to the stylesheet processor can come from an XML parser in the\n *      form of a DOM tree or through the SAX API.\n *\n *   8) DTD is a document type declaration.  It is a way of specifying the\n *      grammar for an XML file, the names and types of elements, attributes,\n *      etc.\n *\n *   9) Translet is an invented term that refers to the class file that contains\n *      the compiled form of a stylesheet.\n */\n    // These message should be read from a locale-specific resource bundle\n    /** Get the lookup table for error messages.\n     *\n     * @return The message lookup table.\n     */\n    public Object[][] getContents()\n    {\n      return new Object[][] {\n        /*\n         * Note to translators:  the substitution text in the following message\n         * is a class name.
